# Detector Features

The gem provides several powerful detection and analysis features:

## 1. Infrastructure Detection

[Base.infrastructure](mdc:lib/detector/base.rb#Infrastructure) can identify over 30 cloud providers and hosting services by examining hostname patterns:

```ruby
detector = Detector.detect("postgres://user:pass@ec2-12-34-56-78.amazonaws.com/mydb")
detector.infrastructure  # => "Amazon Web Services"
```

## 2. Geographic Location

Several methods provide geographic insights:
- `geography`: City, region, and country information
- `region`: Cloud region (AWS, Azure, GCP) based on hostname and location
- `asn`: Autonomous System Number for network identification

The region detection is particularly advanced, with pattern matching for over 70 cloud regions across major providers.

## 3. User Access Levels

Each addon implements a `user_access_level` method to analyze user permissions:

- PostgreSQL: [postgres.rb#user_access_level](mdc:lib/detector/addons/postgres.rb)
  - Detects superuser, replication, and read-only status
  
- MySQL/MariaDB: [mysql.rb#user_access_level](mdc:lib/detector/addons/mysql.rb)
  - Analyzes GRANT statements for privileges
  
- Redis: [redis.rb#user_access_level](mdc:lib/detector/addons/redis.rb)
  - Checks ACLs in Redis 6.0+ or functional tests in older versions

## 4. Database Statistics

For database systems, the gem can report:
- Database counts and sizes
- Table counts and sizes
- Row counts for tables
- Usage statistics

This provides a quick way to assess database systems without direct administrative access.
